<h1>Our History!</h1>

<body>

<h2>How'd we come together?</h2>
<p>It all started back in the great old year of 2015, when my group of buddies and I were stumbling around this totally creepy and off-putting mansion. We heard it was abandoned from a couple rooms back at my lousy middle school, so we thought we'd try and prove em all wrong that ghosts were a bunch of fiction and NONSENSE!!!!!</p>

<p>But my dear reader.... Turns out we were WRONG............ ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨ (gasp!)</p>

<p>Yeah, turns out that ghosts are TOTALLY REAL!!! While we were exploring that old place, my buddy Eric turned around and got jumped by this creepy and sinister ghost with a hundred year lust for BLOOOOOODD!!!!! ãƒ½(ï¾ŸÐ”ï¾Ÿ)ï¾‰</p>

<h4><i>^ The very creepy and sinister ghost in question.</i></h4>
<h4><i>We called him Jimmy.</i></h4>

<h2>Wooaahhh!! How'd we get out?</h2>

<p>We totally would've been toast... But luckily my buddy Tom's an expert in ghost hunting, and he just so happened to have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum">VERY advanced and top secret weapon</a> with him to defeat the ghost once and for all!</p>

<p>After taking out Jimmy and sealing him away, we were suddenly approached by the president of the United States of America: BARACK OBAMAAAAAA!!!!!!â˜…â˜…â˜… Obama told us that he was putting together a top secret organization of ghost busters called the GHOST CATCHERS, and he asked us to work with him on his missions! Of course, you already know how that turned out, dear viewer...</p>

<p><b>AND NOW-- WE'RE IN BUSINESS!!! </b></p>
